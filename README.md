# HOLISTIC-SKIN-TYPE-AND-WELLNESS-ADVISOR

## Holistic Skin Type and Wellness Advisor
The Holistic Skin Type and Wellness Advisor is an intelligent deep learning–based system designed to automatically identify a user’s skin type from facial images and provide personalized wellness and skincare recommendations in real time.


## About
Holistic Skin Type and Wellness Advisor is a deep learning–driven application that analyzes facial skin characteristics using computer vision techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Traditional skin analysis methods rely on manual observation, questionnaires, or dermatologist consultations, which are often subjective, time-consuming, and costly.

This project overcomes these limitations by providing an automated, real-time skin analysis solution using a webcam. The system captures facial images, preprocesses them to handle lighting and noise variations, and applies a CNN model to classify the skin type into categories such as oily, dry, normal, and combination. Based on the detected skin type, the system generates holistic wellness recommendations including skincare routines, hydration guidance, dietary suggestions, and lifestyle tips.

The project demonstrates the effective integration of deep learning, image processing, and wellness advisory systems to deliver an accurate, user-friendly, and cost-effective solution for personal skin care and overall well-being.
